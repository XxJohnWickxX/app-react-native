# Prueba react native

Atomic design was used as the design methodology for this test.

```yarn``` is used as package manager


To run the project you need node.js

 https://nodejs.org/es/

The project is downloaded with

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/XxJohnWickxX/app-react-native.git
 ```
 

already downloaded

```bash
cd prueba-app
```

already in the root of the project you need to install the dependencies

```bash
thread installation
````

*Only for iOS*
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
````

*You must previously have cocoapods installed*

then a link to the libraries
```bash
react-natove link
````

now you can run the application with
```bash
react-native run-ios
````

or
```bash
react-native run-android
```
